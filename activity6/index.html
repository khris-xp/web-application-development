        <img src="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/assets/brand/bootstrap-social.png" class="img-fluid"
            alt="Responsive image">
        <p class="p-4">First of all, when looking at the bootstrap HTML markup, especially the grid system, there are
            too many unnecessary tags around. It's very hard to find out where the real functioning markups are. Also,
            it's not hard to write CSS from the beginning and achieve the same layout by less or more efficient
            markup, css. By using flexbox and BEM, the component markup can be really good and semantic. Secondly, when
            it goes to complex design, sometimes bootstrap just can't handle it. Eventually you have to
            write your own css and js lib. Then you will find some conflicts happens… Because bootstrap's style and js
            lib is so widely covering every aspect of utility css. Last, by using bootstrap, you may learn less, and
            lose some fun of coding… especially when you see the
            unnecessary From another point of view, bootstrap is not all evil, and has a lot of good parts. As a
            reference, I
            have learned tons of css skills, js API designs from it. From v4, bootstrap has made the utility css
            class more specific, a good move to avoid conflicting. So, don't use bootstrap. Read it's code and write
            your better version. :)</p>

        <div class="p-4">
            <p class="font-weight-bold" style="font-weight: bold;">PHP is a popular programming language that has been
                around for over 25 years. It
                is
                used to power some of
                the most popular websites in the world, including Wikipedia, Facebook, and WordPress. However, in recent
                years, PHP has become increasingly unpopular with the new generation of developers.</p>
            <p>
                There are a number of reasons for this. One reason is that PHP has a reputation for being a messy and
                inconsistent language. It has a lot of legacy code and bad practices, which can make it difficult to
                learn and use.

                Another reason is that PHP is not as well-suited for modern web development as some other languages. For
                example, it does not have strong support for asynchronous programming or object-oriented programming.

                Finally, PHP has a reputation for being a language for beginners. This is because it is relatively easy
                to learn and get started with. However, this also means that there is a lot of low-quality PHP code out
                here, which can give the language a bad reputation.
            </p>
            <p>Here are some of the specific reasons why the new generation hates PHP:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is an old language: PHP was first released in 1995, and it has not changed much since then. This
                    makes it feel outdated and out of touch with modern web development.</li>
                <li>It is not well-suited for modern web development: PHP does not have strong support for
                    object-oriented programming, asynchronous programming, or other modern web development
                    techniques.</li>
                <li>It has a reputation for being a language for beginners: This means that there is a lot of
                    low-quality
                    PHP code out there, which can give the language a bad reputation.</li>

        <p class="p-4">Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other
            templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.
            It's fast, flexible, and reliable — with zero-runtime.</p>

        <p class="p-4">React. js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces
            specifically for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps.
            React also allows us to create reusable UI components. React allows developers to create large web
            applications that can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast,
            scalable, and simple. It works only on user interfaces in the application.</p>

        <div class="p-4">
            In the fast-paced world of programming languages, the emergence of Go, commonly known as Golang, has been
            nothing short of a sensation. Since its inception by Google engineers Rob Pike, Ken Thompson, and Robert
            Griesemer in 2007, Go has sparked a flurry of debates, discussions, and downright controversies. Some hail
            it as the next big thing in software development, while others remain skeptical about its merits. In this
            article, we'll delve into the controversy and clarity surrounding Go and explore why it's still a go-to
            language for many experienced developers.

        </h4>

        <div class="p-4">
            Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of websites and
            apps (often called “web design”), but the “web development” term is usually reserved for the actual
            construction and programming of websites and apps.
            Think of all the web pages you have used over the years. Web Developers built those sites, making sure they
            functioned properly and performed in ways that allowed for a great user experience. Web Developers do this
            by writing lines of code, using a variety of programming languages, which vary depending on the tasks they
            are performing and the platforms they are working on.
